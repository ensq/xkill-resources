// Define a binding between events by using this format
// <Fmod event number/name> = <game event number/name>
// Example:
// Fire = 4// This will bind fmod event "Fire" to game event '4'
// 
// 1 = CreateProjectile
// This will bind fmod event '1' to the 'CreateProjectile' game event
// Event names can be found in 'events.cfg'

//0 = Loop
1 = Fire Gun
2 = Player Hit
3 = Player Death
4 = Player Respawn
5 = Play Music
