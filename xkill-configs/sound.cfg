// Define a binding between events by using this format
// <Fmod event number> = <game event number>
// <Fmod event number> = <game event name>
// Example:
// 0 = 4// This will bind fmod event '0' to game event '4'
// 
// 1 = CreateProjectile
// This will bind fmod event '1' to the 'CreateProjectile' game event
// Event names can be found in 'events.cfg'

//0 = Loop
1 = Player Respawn
2 = Create Projectile
3 = Player Death
4 = Player Hit
5 = Start Music
