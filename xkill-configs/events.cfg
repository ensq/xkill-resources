// This file is a conversion table between in-game event numbers and names.
// Use following formatting:
// <event number> = <event name>
// The names are allowed to contain spaces.
// The names are not allowed to begin with a number as this will be treated as
// a event number. 
// This file will be used to convert fmod events to in-game events.
